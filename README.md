# Virtual Window Remote Control

The Remote Control component of the Virtual Window System is a hardware-based device designed to provide intuitive, tactile control over the virtual window experience.\
This ESP32-powered device connects via Bluetooth to the Virtual Window system, allowing users to adjust settings like brightness, volume, and ambient music directly from their workspace.

## Hardware Components

- **ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4.3**: Development board with integrated LCD touchscreen (https://www.waveshare.net/wiki/ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4.3)
- **18650 Battery**: Rechargeable lithium-ion battery for portable operation
- **Battry box with PH2.0 Connector**: For reliable battery connections
- **Power Switch**: To control power on/off

## üõ†Ô∏è Deployment Instructions

Follow these steps to deploy the Remote Control firmware onto the **ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4.3** development board using the **Arduino IDE**.

### üîß Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following:

- **ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4.3** development board
- USB Type-C cable
- Arduino IDE installed (preferably the latest version)
- ESP32 board support installed in Arduino IDE (via Boards Manager)

---

### üì¶ Step 1: Install Required Libraries

1. Open **Arduino IDE**.
2. Go to **Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries**.
3. Search and install the following libraries:
   - `LVGL` (Light and Versatile Graphics Library)
   - `ESP_IOExpander_Library` (for hardware control)

> üí° For detailed installation instructions, refer to the official Waveshare guide:

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 2: Configure Board Settings

1. Go to **Tools > Board > ESP32 Arduino**.
2. Select your board: **ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4.3** or **ESP32S3 Dev Module** (or equivalent).
3. Set the following options in the Tools menu:

| Option | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Upload Mode** | UART0 |
| **PSRAM** | OPI PSRAM |
| **Flash Mode** | QIO |
| **Flash Frequency** | 80MHz |
| **Flash Size** | 8MB |
| **Partition Scheme** | 8MB with spiffs |

---

### üîå Step 3: Connect the Device

1. Connect the **ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4.3** to your computer using a USB Type-C cable.
2. Ensure the board is recognized by your system:
   - Check the **Tools > Port** menu in Arduino IDE to confirm the correct COM port is selected.

---

### üì§ Step 4: Compile and Upload the Project

1. Open the project `.ino` file in Arduino IDE.
2. Review and adjust any configuration parameters if needed (e.g., BLE service UUIDs, default settings).
3. Click the **Verify** button (‚úîÔ∏è) to compile the code.
4. Once compilation is successful, click the **Upload** button (‚û°Ô∏è) to flash the firmware onto the device.

> ‚è±Ô∏è The upload may take a minute. Once complete, the device will automatically reset and start running the firmware.

---

### üß™ Step 5: Test the Remote Control

1. Power on the device (ensure the power switch is engaged).
2. The screen should display the **Connection Status Screen**.
3. Use the touchscreen to navigate to the **Main Control Screen**.
4. Pair the remote with the **Projector App** via Bluetooth.
5. Test brightness, volume, and background music controls to ensure they sync with the projector app.
